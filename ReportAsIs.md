Strategy: low cost and fast delivery

## Culture

### Assumptions
 
 - "We always did it like this and it always worked"
 - "Not big deal if we can not deliver the right product (pizza)"
 - "It's better to have less employees than needed offering a low quality service/product than hiring more employees"
 - "to pay employees as few as possible"
 - "It's better to be unable to offer some products than stocking raw materials risking to waste money"

It is important to notice that the three pizzerias have no mechanism or office dedicated to horizontal communication, instead the owners use phone calls to communicate if something is out of stock in one of the branches to get it from one of the other two, so no information is stored about it. Accounting is done by counting the money by hand at the end of the day by the product owner.

### Type of structure

**Geografical**

Every function is replicated in all pizzerias: Management (done by the owners), accounting (done by the owner), manufactoring (pizza chef), marketing (deliverer also distributes advertisement letters), customer service (getting orders, done by the cashier).

### IT/IS  group / office


There is no IT/IS office.
The IT part of this organization is an external online food order service (just eat).


The activities for inventory, accounting and restock are managed by the pizza chef (producing only handwritten notes on paper) 


estimation of expense in IS:

just eat paper = 7,5€/month * 3 = 270€ per year 
ticket order post-it + pens = 10€/month * 3 = 360€ per year 
expense IS (paper) = 360+270 = 630€<br>
num working days in a year = about 330 days
Average Person hours for IS per working day = about 6 hours per pizzeria (considering order management and inventory) * 3 pizzerias = 18
Salary [€/hours] = 7€/hours
expense in IS (employees) = Salary * person hours per working day * num working days in a year = 7 * 18 * 330 = 41580€ per year <br>
expense in IS (Total) = expense in IS (employees) + expense IS (paper) =  41580€ + 630€ = 42210€
**expense in IS (Total) = 42210€**<br>
**Report ratio: expense in IS / Turn over = 42210/1050000 = 0,0402**

### Other expenses (just eat fees)

just eat fees = about 14% <br>
just eat ratio = just eat orders/tot orders = 0,25 <br>
expense in IS (fees)= just eat fees * just eat ratio * turnover = 0,14 * 0,25 * 1.050.000 = 36750 € per year <br>

## Formalization / specialization/ centralization

**Formalization:** low level of formalization, there aren't any specific standards or documents for this kind of activity (except for HACCP procedures)

**Specialization:** most of the task can be performed by every employee but some specific tasks like cooking pizzas require specific skills so can be performed only by a sub-group of employees (the owners)

**Centralization:** There is no centralization since all of the branches have their owner that has complete freedom over the management of their branch.

## Organizational type

The *Pizzeria due fratelli* organization is an entrepreneurial start up with a very low level of formalization (problems are handled on the fly without standard procedures) and a primitive hierarchical structure (all decisional power is in the hand of the owners)

# Summary analysis

Critical points in the organization and their possible interaction with IS.

- Hand management of post-it orders ticket in the kitchen by the pizza chef leads to two problems: wrong hand-sorting of orders by time (leading to latency in the production of an order) and physical loss of post-its in the messy environment of the kitchen (leading to complete loss of orders or loss of customer address, needed for the order delivery).
- Absence of a way to keep track of the ingredients storage levels leads to the cashier accepting also orders that cannot be satisfied due to lack of the needed ingredients, causing customer unsatisfaction, damage of reputation and money loss.

IT system is basically absent except for the just eat account.
